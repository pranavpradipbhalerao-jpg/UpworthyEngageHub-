## Overview
Welcome to the **UpworthyEngageHub**, an interactive Tableau dashboard developed as part of the **Upworthy Impact Initiative**. This project analyzes the Upworthy dataset to optimize content engagement, leveraging funnel analysis, A/B testing, and custom metrics. The dashboard visualizes 376M+ impressions and 5.74M clicks to provide actionable insights for content creators and marketers. Built with Tableau and supported by Python data preprocessing, this repository showcases my work as a data analyst.

## Project Details
- **Dataset**: Upworthy dataset (sourced from `funnel_data.csv`, `top_headlines.csv`, `ab_test_winners.csv`, `upworthy_clean.csv`)
- **Tools**: Tableau, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Completion Date**: September 2025
- **GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/YourUsername/UpworthyEngageHub](https://github.com/pranavpradipbhalerao-jpg/UpworthyEngageHub)
- **License**: MIT

## Key Achievements
- Analyzed 376,529,158 impression records from the Upworthy dataset using Tableau to optimize content engagement.
- Engineered funnel analysis and A/B testing visualizations, highlighting click-through rates of 1.52% overall and 1.59% for top-performing headlines (up to 18.34% CTR).
- Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard (Upworthy Engage & Evolve Hub) visualizing 5,741,684 clicks, revealing insights into engagement driven by optimized headlines.
- Created custom conversion (1.52%) and win rate (1.59%) metrics to rank high-impact content, enabling targeted storytelling and performance strategies.

## Business Insights
- **Engagement Optimization**: The baseline conversion rate of 1.52% (5,741,684 clicks from 376,529,158 impressions) indicates a significant drop-off, suggesting opportunities to enhance headline appeal. Top headlines, such as "Her Dad Thinks Being Gay Was Her Choice..." (18.34% CTR), demonstrate the potential for impactful storytelling to boost engagement.
- **A/B Testing Impact**: A/B tests with statistically significant p-values (e.g., 6.77e-10 for a 0.0289% vs. 0.0100% CTR comparison) highlight winning headlines that outperform losers by up to 2.88% CTR, offering a clear strategy for content refinement.
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimized headlines, representing a small fraction of tests, drive disproportionate engagement, enabling marketers to focus efforts on high-potential content and maximize ROI.
- **Trend Identification**: The dataset spans multiple test weeks (e.g., 201326 to 201516), allowing for trend analysis to adapt strategies to seasonal or audience shifts.
